# Mixed-Sorting

Guuuyyyysss I felt so big brain after doing this one AHHAHAHAHA even though I should NOT have felt that way. The solution I produced is actually pretty inefficient (not fast enough). But I did it in under 5 tries so I'm vvvv happy!

***Question: Given a list of integers nums, sort the array such that:***


***All even numbers are sorted in increasing order***


***All odd numbers are sorted in decreasing order***


***The relative positions of the even and odd numbers remain the same***


I noticed that the direction I was initially going in would actually produce a faster code, however I realised that it'd be more lines of code and thus calculated (wrongly) that it was probably a dumber method of doing it so I left it.

Anywho the current solution I have traverses through the loop twice and compares i and j only if they are both even and both odd and replaces them respectively. It was very satisfying to do this question.

I'll also be uploading someone else's solution which is similar to what I had initially planned to do. All credits given ofc.
